This repository contains the code and relevant maps/images used for building geologic maps/models in Minecraft.
This is part of an earth sciences outreach program designed to create outreach materials which will hopefully inspire more interest in geosciences amongst younger people.
My project is to build geologic maps/models of Newfoundland in Minecraft.
I am also going to be building smaller models containing ore bodies  and will use Python code to generate gravity data from those models.
These geophysical gravity models and data can be used to explain how and wwhy we use gravity data and build gravity models, and how the models are similar to Minecraft worlds.
Much of the initial work involves using other programs such as WorldPainter and QGIS. The work I'm doing in these programs is explained in text files located in the additional info folder.
